# GraphIsomorphism

A simple program that lets you draw two graphs and see if they are isomorphic. Double clicking on either half of the canvas creates a new node. Clicking one node and then clicking another node creates an edge between the two. Clicking "Check isomorphism" prints whether the two graphs are isomorphic to the console. 

This is a work in progress. I intend to add animation to smoothly deform the right graph to equal the left graph if they are isomorphic. I would also like to make the GUI nicer. 

Requires tkinter, matplotlib, numPy, keyboard, and networkx.
